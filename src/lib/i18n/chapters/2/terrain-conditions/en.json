    "intro": "When preparing the description of the physical condition, it is mandatory to mention the terrain conditions here. Although Nepal is small in terms of area, it is considered rich in the world in terms of terrain diversity. Especially during the geological process, when the Mahalangur mountain range was formed recently, the Tethys Sea existing between the Tibetan block and the Indian subcontinent ceased to exist due to the collision between them, and the land surface of the entire country was formed by the combination of the High Himalayas, the Middle Mahabharat mountain range, the lower Chure mountain range, and the Terai region which is a part of the vast Ganges plain spread in the southernmost part. It is found that there is a dominance of one or another type of terrain among the objective characteristics of this terrain in the rural municipalities or municipalities of Nepal. The terrain structure plays a crucial role in development and construction. Basic aspects such as slope, aspect, elevation, land cover, and soil texture fall under the terrain description."
