            "text": "The geological structure of the municipality was formed during the formation of the Mahabharat mountain range, which originated from the collision between the Indian Plate and the Tibetan Plate. It remains as a part of the vast Ganges River. However, looking at the terrain profile, diversity is found in soil and rocks. The reasons for this are the natural phenomena constantly occurring on the land surface such as weather and seasonal changes, soil erosion, atmospheric pressure effects, rainfall, dew, earthquakes, climate change, normal storms, etc. As it is located in the Inner Terai and some parts in the hilly region, clayey soil is found in the hilly areas and sandy soil in the flat areas of the municipality. Thus, the amount of organic matter is slightly higher in areas where continuous cultivation is being done, while it is gradually decreasing in barren areas."
