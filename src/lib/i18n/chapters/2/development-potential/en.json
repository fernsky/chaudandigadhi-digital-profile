    "intro": "Every place has its own characteristics. Some places have abundant forest areas. Some places have sufficient water resources, while some places are dry areas. Therefore, one can prosper by commercializing agriculture in arable areas, while local levels with abundant forest areas can be made prosperous through sustainable forest management. Based on available resources and means, the municipality's potential can be highlighted. Of the total area, 29.70 percent is cultivable land here. Prosperity can be achieved here through scientific agricultural systems.",

Within the municipality area, there are potential areas for the development of traditional and modern agriculture, herbs, tourism, animal husbandry, and small and medium industries under possibilities and opportunities.

Due to the lack of modern agricultural technology, fertilizers, and tools, as well as their high cost, their usage has decreased, and agricultural production has not increased as required. There are ample possibilities to improve the economic situation by increasing agricultural and livestock production through awareness, skill and commercialization, modernization, technology transfer, and simplifying the availability of necessary technology, fertilizers, credit, and seeds."

If haphazard settlement development can be managed, old traditional irrigation canals repaired to increase soil fertility, and work done according to the concept of sustainable development, this municipality can be developed as a livable place for future generations."

Since there are some streams and ponds for commercial fish farming in the municipality area, and if ponds and artificial lakes are constructed in more potential places and fish farming business suitable for the climate of this area is done, employment opportunities will easily increase, and there is a possibility that the fish of the municipality itself will take over the market."
