    "intro": "After the first draft of the municipality's status description was prepared in the prescribed format, a one-day validation workshop was organized in the executive to discuss the draft of the status description. The following tasks were carried out in the validation workshop: collecting suggestions for improvement to ensure the accuracy and factuality of the information and descriptions presented, exchanging suggestions to include subject areas or aspects that need to be revised that the draft of the status description could not cover, confirming the interrelationship and comparative aspects of the data, information and descriptions presented in the status description, and expressing commitment to use these descriptions in plan translation, development construction, service delivery, performance and result monitoring after the publication of the status description."
