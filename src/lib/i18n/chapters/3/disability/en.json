    "intro": "Disability is defined as a condition where it is difficult to conduct daily activities normally and fully participate in social life due to obstacles created by physical, social, and cultural environments as well as communication because of problems in body parts and physical systems.",
    "intro_2": "Mainly, the causes of disability in individuals include lack of iodized salt use, Trachoma disease caused by lack of face washing in rural areas, accidents, congenital issues, natural disasters, malnutrition, lack of healthcare, conflict or war, or the use of explosives, etc. To reduce this, both preventive and curative actions should be taken. The Disability Protection and Welfare Act, 2039 and the Action Plan on Disability, 2063 have been prepared and implemented covering 19 areas to protect and promote the rights, interests, and development of persons and children with disabilities. Similarly, on December 27, 2009, Nepal ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2006.",
    "subsectionTitle": "Population Distribution by Type of Disability",
    "subsectionContent": "For the distribution of disability identity cards, persons with disabilities are divided into seven types: physical disability, blind and low vision, speech and hearing related disability, hard of hearing and deaf, deaf-blindness, mental disability, intellectual disability, and multiple disability. Based on severity, they are divided into four levels: Level A (red card), Level B (blue card), Level C (yellow card), and Level D (white card), and identity cards have started being distributed. Although some basic income-generating and skill-based training has been conducted to bring changes in the socio-economic status of this community, various programs should be implemented to increase their self-confidence and maintain their access to local resources and bodies to keep them free from community neglect. According to the National Census 2021, among the total population in the municipality, there are 1,562 persons with disabilities. Among them, 501 persons have physical disabilities, and 334 persons have low vision. Similarly, there are 80 blind persons, 158 deaf persons, 99 persons with low hearing power, 33 deaf-blind persons, 128 speech-impaired persons, 50 persons with mental disabilities, 27 persons with intellectual disabilities, 16 persons with hemophilia, 10 persons with autism, and 126 persons with multiple disabilities. The detailed distribution is as follows:",
