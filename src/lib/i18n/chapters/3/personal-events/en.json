    "intro": "Citizens must follow legal processes to exercise their personal rights. To obtain citizenship, passports, or other identity cards, to engage in employment or enterprise, or to go abroad, certain legal processes must be completed. For this, the government provides official certificates. Events such as birth, death, migration, marriage, and divorce must be registered in a timely manner. The Constitution has guaranteed various rights to citizens. Its starting point is vital event registration. It is an international recognition to create national statistics based on those vital event registrations. Where? How many were born? How many died? How many migrated? How many got divorced? The state must have information about such things. Based on this, the government formulates policies related to service delivery, so it is necessary to increase public awareness to register vital events on time. The details of vital events registered in this municipality are presented in the table below.",
