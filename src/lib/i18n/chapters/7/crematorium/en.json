    "content": "In Nepal, the custom of performing death rites according to one's religious tradition has been going on since ancient times. Management of cremation sites and burial grounds according to the religion and culture of every municipality and every community is an important and sensitive issue and necessity. This issue, which also carries emotional meaning, should be addressed by any plan in time. Otherwise, unmanaged cremation adds a challenge to the environmental, social and cultural system of the municipality. Traditionally operating cremation sites and burial grounds should be made easy and organized in the future. Currently, the residents of Ward Nos. 9, 10 and 5 of this municipality are seen crematory on the banks of the Triyuga River, while the residents of other wards perform the last rites in open places and traditionally practiced river banks due to the lack of organized cremation sites and burial grounds. In the coming days, it is necessary for the municipality to start works such as building shelters for the management of cremation sites and burial grounds in necessary places, managing wood/firewood, managing worship shops so that necessary materials for death rites are available."
