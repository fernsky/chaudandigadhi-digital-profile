Although the urban areas of Nepal have almost embraced the revolution in the field of information and communication, television, newspapers, internet, telephone, mobile and courier services are yet to be expanded in rural areas. Fully developing these means of communication and technology and introducing rural people to the world of information and communication remains challenging. The Constitution of Nepal has defined the people's right to information as a fundamental right.
