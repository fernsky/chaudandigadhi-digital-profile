    "number": "7.2.3",
    "content": "Helping to maintain environmental balance can be achieved if dependence on petroleum products is reduced and the use of renewable alternative energy is widespread. Since products like diesel, petrol, and kerosene are not produced in Nepal, we have to spend billions of rupees annually on importing petroleum products. For Nepal, a landlocked developing country, this is a major cause of foreign trade deficit. In the context where we are unable to effectively implement the policy of import substitution and export management in practice, we can become self-reliant in energy sources through the development of wind energy, solar energy, electrical energy, and biogas. Therefore, in the case of Nepal, local governments, provincial governments, and the federal government must formulate necessary policies and work for the development of renewable alternative energy."
