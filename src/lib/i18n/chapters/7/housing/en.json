    "content": "There are settlements with mixed population density in the municipality. Regarding settlement, it is customary to live scattered in areas suitable for market potential, water facilities, agricultural land, animal husbandry, and grain production. Therefore, depending on convenience, there are dense and sparse settlements in all wards. Most of the houses here are in raw and semi-permanent condition, while only a few houses are in permanent condition, meaning that the houses in this area are not free from risk from the perspective of earthquake and other disaster safety."
