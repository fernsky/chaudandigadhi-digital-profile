    "content": "If the local government works by prioritizing public health, healthy and positive thinking citizens can be produced and they can contribute to the development, construction and service sectors. Therefore, it seems desirable for the local government to formulate and implement a policy that certain criteria must be met before slaughtering meat animals and birds, ensuring the people's right to food security by constructing a clean slaughterhouse equipped with modern technology. There is no organized slaughterhouse in Chaudandigadhi Municipality. Animals are slaughtered in fresh houses and open places."
