If facilitated and safe bus parks are constructed, the quality of transport service increases. Structures built in bus parks must be disability friendly. Although Beltar Buspark is in operation in Ward No. 6 of this municipality, it is not in an organized state. Similarly, main market areas of the municipality are serving as bus stops. There is a lack of passenger waiting sheds and toilets here. Details regarding bus parks and bus stops operating in the municipality are presented in the table.",
