Mainly trucks, tractors, jeeps, buses, and motorcycles seem to be used in this municipality. It seems necessary to upgrade road routes in all wards of the municipality so that they operate throughout the year. Also, various infrastructures required for road transport such as vehicle parking lots, bus stops, passenger waiting sheds, street lights, road signs, and facilities related to bus terminals need to be developed in an organized manner."
