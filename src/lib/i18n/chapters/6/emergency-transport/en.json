    "content": "Although there is access to health services at the municipality center, emergency health services could not be delivered from health institutions of all wards. To provide health services to patients in emergency situations, 6 ambulances, 1 fire engine and 1 fire extinguisher are in operation with 24-hour service within the municipality. It seems necessary to arrange additional necessary ambulances in various wards of the municipality to provide service in emergency situations in various communities."
