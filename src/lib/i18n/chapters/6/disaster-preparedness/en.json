    "content": "Due to geographical complexity, Nepal is in a high-risk zone for natural disasters. Large amounts of life and property are lost annually in Nepal due to natural disasters. The pain of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal is still fresh. The municipality is also in a sensitive state from the perspective of natural disasters. Especially natural disasters like floods, river erosion, storms, hailstones, lightning, lack of rain, dry drought, and forest fires have been appearing in this municipality. The past COVID-19 and epidemics spreading at various times have had a deep impact on economic and other sectors as well. Although such disasters generally cannot be fully controlled, the loss of life and property can be minimized by adopting impact mitigation measures. The municipality has put forward policies such as making the municipal-level disaster management committee and ward-level disaster management committee more active and effective, managing essential materials for disasters, continuing embankment and river control works in risky places caused by various flash floods and rivers using funds obtained from extraction and sale of riverine materials to minimize water-induced disaster damage, formulating and implementing the municipality's local disaster risk management plan for effective and planned management of disasters, establishing a disaster fund and operating emergency assistance programs, publishing and broadcasting awareness-raising subjects through local media to avoid disaster and epidemic problems, as well as coordinating, collaborating and partnering with government and non-government bodies active in this sector."
