    "title": "Forest Area Status",
    "number": "6.1",
    "content": "Forest and jungle areas occupy 57.75 percent of the total geographical area of the municipality. Sustainable Development Goal No. 15 mentions sustainable management of forests, combating desertification, halting and reversing land degradation, and halting biodiversity loss. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize the conservation of forests to maintain ecological balance, atmospheric cleanliness, and wildlife habitat. On the other hand, if extensive tree plantation is carried out in barren lands outside the forest area and river banks in this municipality, the municipality can be developed as a green garden and forests can be linked to income generation to a limited extent. Similarly, tree plantation, dam construction, wire fencing, embankments, and traditional flood and inundation control and soil conservation programs need to be implemented in highly sensitive areas in terms of soil conservation. Also, since tree plantation is an effective measure of soil conservation, it is essential to prioritize this work."
