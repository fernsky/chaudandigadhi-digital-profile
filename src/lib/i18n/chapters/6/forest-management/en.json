            "content1": "Community forest means national forest handed over to a user group for the development, conservation and use of the forest for collective interest. According to the policy of the Government of Nepal to involve local residents in forest conservation and use, community forest user groups are being formed and forests are being handed over through the District Forest Office in this municipality. According to the Forest Act, 2049 and Forest Rules, 2051, the community forest user groups themselves are fully responsible for the conservation, enhancement and management of community forests. When this program was initially implemented, its objective was to increase greenery in barren hills and slopes and to meet the basic needs of forest products including wood, firewood and leaves for the general public. However, the main objectives of this program now include poverty alleviation of poor families, livelihood, biodiversity conservation, sustainable forest management, good governance, inclusion, gender equality, especially participation of women, dalits and indigenous people, and it is believed that this program can also help in poverty reduction.",
            "content2": "With the participation of the municipality and community forest user groups, various training seminars and study tours are being conducted to encourage the production of non-timber forest products within community forests. This seems to help advance all aspects of forest management from the local level and increase forest production. Since the manpower of the District Forest Office alone does not seem sufficient for strengthening community forests, various non-governmental organizations related to forests need to be deployed in the municipality for this purpose. Details of community forests registered in this municipality are mentioned in the table below.",
