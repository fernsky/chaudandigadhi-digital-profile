    "content": "The streams and canals spread across various geographical areas and wards of the municipality not only store abundant water but also provide shelter as safe habitats for various types of aquatic animals and birds. Also, it is seen that animals drink water from such streams and farmers also use water for irrigation partially from time to time. Due to the development of human settlements and the pressure of migration, as well as excessive grazing and use of unproductive animals, natural rivers/streams continue to be eroded and buried. Details of streams, canals, rivers, lakes and waterfalls in the municipality are mentioned in the table.",
