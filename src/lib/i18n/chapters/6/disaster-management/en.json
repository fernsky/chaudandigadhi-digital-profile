    "content": "The river and stream banks of the municipality fall in sensitive areas from the perspective of soil erosion. Due to human activities affecting the natural environment, uncontrolled forest fires, grazing trends, and haphazard extraction of stones and sand from streams in the municipality area have disrupted natural balance and concentrated uncontrolled flooding towards settlements and agricultural areas. As riverine materials are being extracted in quantities exceeding the capacity of streams, the possibility of erosion and soil loss in surrounding areas is increasing as the stream surface deepens. The human activities of human settlements centered around the municipality's streams have also adversely affected this sensitive area from the perspective of soil erosion due to seismic hazards. To stop this process, embankment arrangements and drainage systems need to be arranged. Similarly, conflicts between humans and wild animals have been causing various types of human incidents. Considering the need to adopt short-term, medium-term and long-term measures, clear and embankment construction as a short-term measure, plantation around the affected area as a medium-term measure, and conservation of the entire stream-affected area as a long-term measure, work needs to be advanced towards minimizing conflicts between humans and wild animals. It is seen that programs related to intensive watershed area conservation should be implemented without affecting the mentioned areas by human activities."
