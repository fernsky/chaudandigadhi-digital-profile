        "p1": "Article 35 of the Constitution of Nepal establishes the right to health as a fundamental right. Sub-article 1 states that every citizen shall have the right to get basic health services free of cost from the State, and no one shall be deprived of emergency health services. As the responsibility of implementing this right lies with the local government, it is inevitable to arrange basic health infrastructure and services in the municipality.",
        "p2": "Currently, general level health services in the municipality are being provided from the basic city hospital and health posts and health centers located here. There is one basic city hospital (Ward No. 7) Beltar, 5 health posts (Ward No. 4, 1, 8, 5, 9) and 6 basic health centers (3, 2, 6, 5, 10, 10) in operation in the municipality."
