    "sdgContent": "Sustainable Development Goals Status & Roadmap: According to 2016-2030 (SDG-6), in the base year 2015, only 15 percent of the population is seen consuming safe drinking water. According to the document which also mentions the sustainable development goal monitoring framework, this population is expected to increase gradually. Accordingly, ambitious targets have been set to reach 35 percent in 2019, 50 percent in 2022, 65 percent in 2025 and 90 percent of the total population as safe drinking water users by 2030. To support the achievement of the said national goal and to improve the public health of the general public, it seems necessary to spread widespread public awareness about testing the suitability of water and safety measures while using water.",
