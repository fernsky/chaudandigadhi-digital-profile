        "It is necessary to have good arrangement of drainage in places with city market centers and integrated settlements. Drainage is also an important infrastructure of physical development. If drainage management is done along with road construction, the government saves double expenditure on infrastructure development. Apart from this, waste emitted from human settlements should be managed by creating a landfill site at a certain distance from human settlements. A clean and waste-free environment is a hallmark of civilization.",
        "The municipality has not been able to make proper arrangements for drainage appropriately. However, the municipality is committed to moving forward by formulating an urban development plan. A specific landfill site has not been arranged in the municipality area for waste management. Regarding drainage, the municipality has put forward policies such as making necessary arrangements for drainage in markets/settlements of the municipality area, making the Tole Development Institution responsible for adopting a zero-cost policy in waste management, and beautifying markets under the municipality including Beltar market."
