        "description": "Research conducted by various organizations on the benefits of family planning has proven that it plays a significant role in improving the health of mothers, children, and newborns. It also helps in gender equality, women's education, and growth and development. Therefore, with the aim of providing quality family planning services, the reproductive health program and family planning program have been expanded since 1991 to hospitals, health posts, basic health centers, and urban clinics, and services are being provided through female community health volunteers. The details of family planning programs in the municipality are presented in the table."

        "description": "From the legal and reproductive health perspective, becoming a mother at the age of 20 or less is considered illegal and risky from the perspective of both maternal and child health. Conception and giving birth in a state of physical, mental, and economic immaturity carries a high risk of birthing an immature, underweight, physically and intellectually disabled infant on the one hand, and on the other hand, due to lack of adequate information on subjects like pregnancy care, mother and child care, nutrition, sanitation, there is a possibility that both mother and infant may fall victim to various types of infections.\n\nNepal has achieved remarkable progress in the field of maternal and child health between the Millennium Development Goals 2000-2015. Considering 1990 as the base year, child mortality under 5 years of age (per thousand) has dropped to 38 by 2015 from 108 deaths per 1000 live births in Nepal. Similarly, considering 1990 as the base year, maternal mortality (per one hundred thousand) has dropped to 258 by 2015 from 850, and statistics show that the proportion of women giving birth from trained health workers has reached 55.6 percent (Nepal and the Millennium Development Goals Final Status Report, 2000- 2015). Looking at this, signs of positive impact in the overall field of maternal and child health are being seen in the municipality.",
