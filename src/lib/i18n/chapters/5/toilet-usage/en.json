    "content": "In many remote urban settlements, people still defecate in water sources and open places. For a civilized society, this practice is a symbol of incivility. Disposal of excreta in open areas allows germs to enter human body through food, water and breathing. Therefore, construction of toilets in every house is a mandatory requirement. Nowadays, the government and various non-governmental organizations are prioritizing toilet construction. Private houses and public places must have toilets with handwashing water. In case families from poor communities cannot build toilets themselves, the government, especially the local government, has to provide subsidies for toilet construction.",
