        "Especially in urban areas and market centers where population density is high, human-generated waste and waste from industries and factories not only disfigure the beauty of the settlement but also have detailed negative impact on public health. In such a situation, the waste management system must be addressed in a long-term manner from both the government and community sides. Realizing that waste harms both health and beauty, proper management of waste is necessary. Organic fertilizer can also be made from some biodegradable waste. The municipality has put forward policies and programs including making necessary arrangements for sewage drainage in markets/settlements within the city area for waste management, making the Tole Development Institution responsible for adopting a zero-cost policy in waste management, and sustainable management of waste in collaboration with Beltar Basaha Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Tole Development Institution and stakeholders under the leadership of Market Management and Development Committee.",

        "Currently, the problems seen in this municipality are as follows:",
        "In the name of waste management, the tendency to throw waste uncontrollably in the low-lying areas of rivers and streams is seen everywhere. The waste thrown in this way is washed away by water during the rainy season and reaches the lower parts of rivers and streams, expanding pollution.",
        "Since the low-lying parts of the land are also sources of water and the same water appears on the surface and seeps into the ground, the waste thrown in the low-lying parts pollutes specifically the surface water and the groundwater.",
        "Things to pay attention to in waste management:",
        "Separating kitchen waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable.",
        "The municipality should conduct training to use biodegradable waste for fertilizer and programs to motivate every homeowner.",
        "Separating non-biodegradable waste into different levels such as wood, plastic, metal, glass. After identifying these wastes as needed, emphasizing the management of related services for those that can be reused.
