    "title": "4.1.3 Import and Export",
    "number": "",
    "content": "For any municipality to be economically strong, exports must be higher than imports. When the volume of exports is larger than imports, it helps increase trade profit and raise the economic level. Only by promoting local products and becoming self-reliant in them can the municipality's economic status be enhanced. The municipality exports agricultural products such as ginger, turmeric, paddy, banana, and lemon, as well as livestock products like goats, chickens, and pigs. On the other hand, it imports items such as additional food items, vegetables, clothing, household electrical appliances, construction materials, educational materials, chemical fertilizers, fruits, health medicines, and equipment. The fact that imports exceed exports indicates a clear trade deficit for the municipality. However, for precise data, the municipality needs to take special initiatives."
