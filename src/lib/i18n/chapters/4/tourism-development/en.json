Tourism is a gift given to us by nature. If all these tourism assets are fully utilized, it is certain that they will make a significant contribution to the country's economic prosperity and strengthen the country's economy. Therefore, the Tourism Policy, 2065, primarily aims to create self-employment through tourism, alleviate poverty, research tangible and intangible heritage, further develop and expand air and land routes, and move forward with tourism infrastructure according to the concept of sustainable development. This municipality also has immense potential for tourism development.",

    "content2": "The municipality has more than 180 sites of historical, religious, and cultural importance, including Shivalaya Temple, Basaha Than Shivalaya Temple, Pushpalal Chowk Park, Mini Apraha Waterfall, Kanya Aulshree Gumba, Dwaradani Devi Sthan, Thanpokhari Temple, Lingeshwar Shivalaya, and 44 nature-based tourist sites. There is also equal potential for homestays and cultural tourism here. Cultural tourism can be promoted by including various cultural programs reflecting the culture of Rai, Magar, and Tharu communities. Additionally, since the municipality leads in the production of agricultural products, fruits, food crops, ginger, turmeric, and lemon, developing those areas as model agricultural zones can attract agricultural tourism. Currently, it is necessary to expand hotels and homestays and other necessary services and facilities for tourists.",
