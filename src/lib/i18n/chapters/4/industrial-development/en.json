    "content1": "Although various efforts have been made for industrial development since the Rana regime, large-scale industries that could lead to an industrial revolution have not been established in Nepal. It is an unfortunate situation that existing industries are becoming sick and closing down. Only by establishing industries based on agriculture and local raw materials and reaching world markets with Nepali products can the foundation for Nepal's rise from a least developed nation be prepared. To promote industry, it is necessary to prioritize and encourage small and medium enterprises based on local resources.",
    "content2": "Small industries, all types of agriculture-based industries, cottage industries, medium industries, large industries, service industries, government industries, community-based industries, collection and processing industries - although large scale industries have not come into operation in the municipality, businesses such as rice mills, grocery shops, clothing shops, fruit and vegetable shops, hardware, book and newspaper shops, furniture, utensil shops, photo studios, medical halls, grains and restaurants are formally registered and operating, which has contributed to the economic development of the municipality."
