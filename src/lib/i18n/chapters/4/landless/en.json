    "content": "In Nepal, family land ownership is closely linked to economic status. Since Nepal's economy is based on agriculture, viewing land ownership as a measure of economic status is natural. However, recently, with increased access to foreign employment and other service sectors, people have started building their economic standing in non-agricultural areas. On the other hand, land ownership is also viewed as one's birthplace or residential site. Therefore, every citizen's land ownership has been regarded as a major socio-economic and political issue for centuries. Additionally, the distribution of land in Nepal is unscientific."
