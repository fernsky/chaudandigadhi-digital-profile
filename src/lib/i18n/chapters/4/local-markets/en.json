    "content": "Except for large cities, in rural areas where dense settlements exist, human activities such as education, health, other services, trade and commerce tend to be concentrated. These centers are called market centers. Although not fully developed from an urban development and facility perspective, human activities are concentrating and developing in these centers as areas that can develop in the future. It is not impossible to develop markets in new areas based on suitability. However, it is easier to further develop existing areas that have already developed to some extent. The details of major market centers and commercial centers of this municipality are presented in the table.",
